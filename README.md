## My process
    In the start of process, i has a little difficult in write the code but a was finish the QR-code component of manner i learn coding and that is the result.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to reinforce the div and link tag for html, and about css I learned the responsive type for the page and improved the site for any type of bed including mobile

```html
<div>I learned to put an icon on the site page using the <link>I used the <div> to improve the positioning of the card </div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  min-width: pixel used for the mobile resolution;
  attribution class for the icon;
}
```

### Continued development

the area I want to work is front-end and probably evolve to full-stack and my future projects will be in this part of sites and with time covering more areas of this branch.
Still not very comfortable because I have little knowledge but really enjoying this experience I am having, and I will continue to learn more and more.


### Useful resources

- [Css tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for part of the flexbox and direction on the site to organize the card and everything I needed.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article that helped me finally understand all sorts of positioning and tagging, literally almost everything I learned was from this site. I recommend it to anyone who is still learning this concept.
